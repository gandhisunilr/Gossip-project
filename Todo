Creation of framework			Sunil ongoing

Things we can do at end: 
Change each factor (eg. Alpha) and show results (We can use D3.js for graphs if we have time and anybody is interested in learning it)
Display results and show what happens when communication is assymmetric (sensor networks)
Use this for computing something over social network graphs
